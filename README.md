# Dating Online App
I will build complete dating website, User will signup using Facebook, Google, Twitter accounts and Email address.
User can send private message in the chat room, user can upload pictures for profile and user can update or delete profile.
User can share posts with image. People can leave comments for each public post that users share.
I will build automatic message from admin, so admin will send welcome message for new users
